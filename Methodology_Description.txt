# Algorithms to Implement:

Please, use the link below to implement the below-mentioned algorithms in the form of a Python script.

- Jupyter notebooks are accepted (as final implementations). 

- If you are interested, you can consult my recent python package for detecting dyslexia to shape the structure of your project and create your test beds

1) Support Vector Machine
2) Random Forest 
3) MLP
4) Convolutional Neural Network
5) Choose from the review_paper in the Papers dir
6) Choose from the review_paper in the Papers dir
7) Choose from the review_paper in the Papers dir


Tune the parameters using:

- Bayesian Optimization vs Grid-Search (let us discuss and decide later) in five fold-cross validation framework. 

- Train and test using 10 fold-cross validation framework
